I've started this project for more than a week now, but I haven't been taking many notes about it
and how to come to make the decisions that I am making.

About the front-end development of my portfolio:

# _What I want is_

- A website(w.) pleasing to look at
- A w. that is simple, user-friendly yet packed with relevant information
  for anyone wondering if to hire me
- A w. that can offer an insight on how I think, rather than how much work I've done
- A proper balance of work experience, what are the values that I follow when I work  
  both alone and in teams

# Structure

- HomePage

  1. One or two 'catchy' sentences that show my character and let the visitor choose between two portfolios: The Developper, or Multimedia (from start ups work to MBM)
  2. Ease of access to social media links and contact (LinkedIn, QuickEmail, GitHub, Twitter)

- A. The Developper

  1. Short on why I chose this area of work
  2. Selection of projects and languages
  3. Selection of tutorials, mentors, resources
  <!-- 3.1 Short Selection of projects? Portfolio-like -->
  4. Short, Medium, Long term projects + Things I want to learn
  5. Links to GitHub, StackOverflow, StackExchange(needed?), LinkedIn

---

- B. Multimedia

  1. What have I done since my degree (short bckgd on what my studies were, include links for more information)
  2. Creation of Mindbridge Media => how it unfolded and where it is now
     Page includes internal links to a page that basically sums up how the covid situation made me
     select different options for my life.
     Page includes links to MindBridge Media YT and FB pages.

# _How_

I have chosen the support of React Js to build my portfolio,
because it's a popular framework used by defi apps developers,
even if it may not be what I want to use on the long term, there's a high chance
that an employer or client wants their project on React.

React is a specific language to learn that I at least want to master the basics of.

# Specifics

** Integrations to search for **
Night/Day Toggle
Pop up for the 2 portfolios options with specific background
=> static page redirecting to 2 different but interconnected projects?

I don't know yet if I want a scroll or a set of static pages interconnected

--- downloaded images that could fit with the principle of my portfolio
--- contacted Oceane for potential collaboration for logo

<!-- Things that are present through the tutorial I'm following and that I'm willing to keep:
        - Navbar
        - -->

In today's session, I've been able to define more precisely what I want my portfolio to be. It won't be an exhibition of projects, but more an insight on how I think, the set of values I could bring to someone's team.
Added more Tools in the data.js
Fixed small bug in display of What Else page
Downloaded some pictures for inspiration
Tried to integrate one of those pictures into my display
-> didn't work, but I'll try again next time
Now I think I reached the stage where I need to watch a few tutorials about React
-> bare minimum for now, otherwise I will dig into a new full on tutorial and won't move forward with this project.

As I'm digging a bit deeper into React, it shows me how I need to get into JavaScript.
----react is owned by Meta----
Started following the React's website's steps
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#before-we-start-the-tutorial

    components are small, isolated pieces used to build a user interface.

May install Material UI, an extension to react.js that will enable more design possibilities
