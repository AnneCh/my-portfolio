### This code is the first version of my portfolio, which I chose to leave aside by starting anew at some point; still I keep the original one, as a reminder.

## PORTFOLIO CREATION

# _What I want is_

- A website(w.) pleasing to look at
- A w. that is simple, user-friendly yet packed with relevant information
  for anyone wondering if to hire me
- A w. that can offer an insight on how I think, rather than how much work I've done
- A proper balance of work experience and the values that I follow in life

# Structure

- HomePage

  1. Invite the visitor to relax and choose between two portfolios: The Developper, or Multimedia
  2. Ease of access to social media links and contact (LinkedIn, QuickEmail, GitHub, Twitter)

- A. The Developper

  1. Short on why I chose this area of work
  2. Selection of projects and languages
  3. Selection of tutorials, mentors, resources
  <!-- 3.1 Short Selection of projects? Portfolio-like -->
  4. Short, Medium, Long term projects + Things I want to learn
  5. Links to GitHub, StackOverflow, LinkedIn

---

- B. Multimedia

  1. What have I done since my degree (short bckgd on what my studies were, include links for more information)
  2. Creation of Mindbridge Media => how it unfolded and where it is now
     Page includes internal links to a page that basically sums up how the covid situation made me
     select different options for my life.
     Page includes links to MindBridge Media YT and FB pages.

# _How_

I have chosen the support of React Js to build my portfolio,
because it's a popular framework used by defi apps developers,
even if it may not be what I want to use on the long term, there's a high chance
that someone I'd be working with would use it. Learning on the job.
